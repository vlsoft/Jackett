CurlSharp
=========

CurlSharp is a .Net binding and object-oriented wrapper for [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/).

libcurl is a web-client library that can provide cross-platform .Net applications with an easy way to implement such things as:

- HTTP ( GET / HEAD / PUT / POST / multi-part / form-data )
- FTP ( upload / download / list / 3rd-party )
- HTTPS, FTPS, SSL, TLS  ( via OpenSSL or GnuTLS )
- Proxies, proxy tunneling, cookies, user+password authentication.
- File transfer resume, byte ranges, multiple asynchronous transfers.
- and much more...

CurlSharp provides simple get/set properties for libcurl's options and information functions, event-based hooks to libcurl's I/O, status, and progress callbacks, and wraps the c-style file I/O behind simple filename properties. The `CurlEasy` class contains has more than 100 different properties and methods to handle a wide variety of URL transfer requirements. While this may seem overwhelming at first glance, the good news is you will probably need only a tiny subset of these for most situations.

The CurlSharp library consists of these parts:

- Pure C# P/Invoke bindings to the libcurl API.
- Optional libcurlshim helper DLL [WIN32].
- The `CurlEasy` class which provides a wrapper around a `curl_easy` session.
- The `CurlMulti` class, which serves as a container for multiple CurlEasy objects, and provides a wrapper around a `curl_multi` session.
- The `CurlShare` class which provides an infrastructure for serializing access to data shared by multiple `CurlEasy` objects, including cookie data and DNS hosts. It implements the `curl_share_xxx` API. 
- The `CurlHttpMultiPartForm` to easily construct multi-part forms.
- The `CurlSlist` class which wraps a linked list of strings used in cURL.

CurlSharp is available for these platforms:

- [Stable] Windows 32-bit
- [Experimental] Win64 port
- [Experimental] Mono Linux & OS X support

#### Examples ####

A simple HTTP download program...

```c#
using System;
using CurlSharp;

internal class EasyGet
{
  public static void Main(String[] args)
  {
    Curl.GlobalInit(CurlInitFlag.All);

    try
    {
      using (var easy = new CurlEasy())
      {
        easy.Url = "http://www.google.com/";
        easy.WriteFunction = OnWriteData;
        easy.Perform();
      }
    }
    finally
    {
      Curl.GlobalCleanup();
    }	
  }

  public static Int32 OnWriteData(byte[] buf, Int32 size, Int32 nmemb, object data)
  {
      Console.Write(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buf));
      return size*nmemb;
  }
}
```

Simple HTTP Post example:

```c#
using (var easy = new CurlEasy())
{
    easy.Url = "http://hostname/testpost.php";
    easy.Post = true;
    var postData = "parm1=12345&parm2=Hello+world%21";
    easy.PostFields = postData;
    easy.PostFieldSize = postData.Length;
    easy.Perform();
}
```

HTTP/2.0 download:

```c#

using (var easy = new CurlEasy())
{
    easy.Url = "https://google.com/";
    easy.WriteFunction = OnWriteData;

    // HTTP/2 please
    easy.HttpVersion = CurlHttpVersion.Http2_0;

    // skip SSL verification during debugging
    easy.SslVerifyPeer = false;
    easy.SslVerifyhost = false;

    easy.Perform();
}
```
